        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p><img src="../images/smith.jpg" alt="" height="200" align = right>
            Linear Smith Machines are the ultimate in weight machines and the LSM400 <br>
            leads the field. Designed for both serious fitness users and beginners, the <br>
            LSM400's vertical design provides all of the safety and control associated <br>
            with Smith Machines, while still allowing for the effective use of gravity <br>
            for effective resistance. You don't even need a workout partner. Lock points <br>
            can be set to prevent the bar from movement outside of your body's natural <br>
            range of motion.</p>
        <p>You can tailor the LSM400 to meet you specific workout needs. Start with the <br>
            basic package of the Smith Machine rack and, as your needs grow, add a  <br>
            lat/row, pec dec, plate tree, dip, and accessory organizer. Accessories are easy <br>
            to insert and remove, allowing you to continue your workout without delay.   <br> 
            The LSM400 works with all standard Olympic weight plates</p>
        <p>The LSM400 is compact with all components place one side of the unit for easy
            access. This makes the LSM400 perfect for people who want a quality home gym, but
            do not have a lot of space. Place the LSM400 against a wall and you're ready
            to go!
            </p>
        <p>Proper Angle: The bar travels along a 7 degree path from vertical. Studies have
            shown that this is the proper lifting angle to increase your comfort and
            prevent injury.</p>
        <p>Safety: The LSM400 has 20 lock-out points for a safe, solid stop at 
            any point in your workout routine.</p>
        <p>Rugged: Constructed with heavy 12 gauge steel and 7 gauge reinforcing plate. This is
            a unit built to last.</p>
        <p>Warranty: Every part of the LSM400 has a lifetime guarantee. We will replace
            or repair anything that goes wrong.</p>
