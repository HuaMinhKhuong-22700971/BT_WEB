    <p><span> Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span>
         After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off
            . I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances</p>
    <p>Here's the text extracted from the image:
        I've started putting up a <a href="Slide1.html">slide show</a>
         of the production. Please feel free to download
          the files from the Web site. If you want high resolution
           photos on a photo CD, please contact me.</p>
